/**
 * Creates eight tasks, each of which flash an LED at a different rate.  The first 
 * LED flashes every 125ms, the second every 250ms, the third every 375ms, etc.
 *
 * The LED flash tasks provide instant visual feedback.  They show that the scheduler 
 * is still operational.
 *
 * The PC port uses the standard parallel port for outputs, the Flashlite 186 port 
 * uses IO port F.

Changes from V2.0.0

Changes from V2.1.1
