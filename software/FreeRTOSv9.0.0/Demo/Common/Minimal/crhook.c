/*
 * This demo file demonstrates how to send data between an ISR and a 
 * co-routine.  A tick hook function is used to periodically pass data between
 * the RTOS tick and a set of 'hook' co-routines.
 *
 * hookNUM_HOOK_CO_ROUTINES co-routines are created.  Each co-routine blocks
 * to wait for a character to be received on a queue from the tick ISR, checks
 * to ensure the character received was that expected, then sends the number
 * back to the tick ISR on a different queue.
 * 
 * The tick ISR checks the numbers received back from the 'hook' co-routines 
 * matches the number previously sent.
 *
 * If at any time a queue function returns unexpectedly, or an incorrect value
 * is received either by the tick hook or a co-routine then an error is 
 * latched.
 *
 * This demo relies on each 'hook' co-routine to execute between each 
 * hookTICK_CALLS_BEFORE_POST tick interrupts.  This and the heavy use of 
 * queues from within an interrupt may result in an error being detected on 
 * slower targets simply due to timing.
