This directory will contain third party sources and/or libraries that it uses by the program into the software directory.

**FreeRTOS**: it is a class of RTOS that is designed to be small enough to run on a microcontroller â€“ although its use is not limited to microcontroller applications. (please visit https://www.freertos.org for more details). Please read the license before to use it (available into the FreeRTOS subdirectory)

**SystemView**: it is a real-time recording and visualization tool for embedded systems that reveals the true runtime behavior of an application, going far deeper than the system insights provided by debuggers. This is particularly effective when developing and working with complex embedded systems comprising multiple threads and interrupts: SystemView can ensure a system performs as designed, can track down inefficiencies, and show unintended interactions and resource conflicts, with a focus on details of every single system ticks.
