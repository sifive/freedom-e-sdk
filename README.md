# SiFive Freedom E SDK README #

This repository, maintained by SiFive Inc, makes it easy to get started developing
software for the Freedom E and Freedom S Embedded RISC-V Platforms. This SDK
is intended to work on any target supported by SiFive's distributions of the
RISC-V GNU Toolchain.

[Documentation for Freedom E SDK is available here](https://sifive.github.io/freedom-e-sdk-docs/index.html)

Freedom E SDK was recently transitioned to using the Freedom Metal compatibility
library. If you're looking for the old Freedom E SDK, software examples, and
board support files, you can find those on the [v1\_0 branch](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk/tree/v1_0).
